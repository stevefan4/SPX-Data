# S&P 500 Sector Performance Dashboard

## Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into the performance of various sectors within the S&P 500. By analyzing key financial metrics, the goal is to help investors, analysts, and researchers understand how different sectors are evolving over time and identify emerging trends. 

### Goals:
1. **Track Sector Performance:** Track and analyze revenue, margins, earnings, balance sheet strength, and M&A/financing activity.
2. **Identify Trends:** Provide visual insights into sector-wide financial health and macroeconomic impacts.
3. **Enhance Decision-Making:** Enable users to make informed investment or strategic business decisions based on historical and current data.
4. **Compare Against Benchmarks:** Compare sector performance against historical norms, economic cycles, and macroeconomic indicators.

### How This Will Be Conveyed:
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Utilize Power BI or Streamlit to create interactive visual representations of financial data.
- **Historical vs. Current Comparisons:** Present trend charts to display sector performance over time.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Use clear visualizations such as bar charts, heat maps, and time series plots to highlight sector strengths and weaknesses.
- **Data Filtering Capabilities:** Allow users to select specific timeframes, sectors, or financial metrics to tailor their analysis.

## Data Sources
The project will utilize data from the following sources:
- **Company Filings** (10-K, 10-Q reports)
- **Bloomberg / FactSet / S&P Capital IQ** (if available)
- **Yahoo Finance / Alpha Vantage** (for publicly accessible data)
- **SEC EDGAR** (for parsing financial statements)
- **FRED** (for macroeconomic context)

```

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard will include the following sections:
1. **Sector Overview**
   - Total revenue, earnings, and margins by sector
   - Trends over time
   - Performance relative to historical averages

2. **Sales and Earnings Trends**
   - Quarterly and annual YoY changes
   - EPS growth vs. revenue growth

3. **Margin Analysis**
   - Gross, operating, and net margins
   - Sector-wise margin expansion/contraction

4. **Balance Sheet Strength**
   - Debt-to-equity and other leverage metrics
   - Cash levels and liquidity analysis

5. **M&A and Financing Activity**
   - Sector-wise M&A transaction volume and deal size
   - IPOs, secondary offerings, and bond issuance trends

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, yfinance, requests, BeautifulSoup)
- **Power BI / Streamlit** (for interactive dashboard visualization)
- **SQL / PostgreSQL** (for storing structured financial data)
- **APIs** (Alpha Vantage, SEC EDGAR, FRED)

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Run Data Collection Scripts**
   ```sh
   python scripts/fetch_data.py
   ```
2. **Process and Clean Data**
   ```sh
   python scripts/process_data.py
   ```
3. **Launch the Dashboard**
   - If using Streamlit:
     ```sh
     streamlit run dashboard/app.py
     ```
   - If using Power BI, open the `.pbix` file

## Future Steps
- [ ] Automate data fetching from APIs and SEC filings
- [ ] Improve visualizations with interactive charts
- [ ] Incorporate macroeconomic overlays for sector analysis
- [ ] Add predictive modeling for sector trends
- [ ] Expand dashboard functionalities to include additional market indices beyond the S&P 500
- [ ] Integrate alternative data sources such as sentiment analysis and insider trading trends
